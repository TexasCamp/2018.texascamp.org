After the camp, we issued a digital survey to camp-goers to get broader input from those who weren’t able to attend that session. Based on the input from these initiatives, and 2017 attendee demographics, we made a few big changes to the camp!</p>\r\n\r\n<h2 dir=\"ltr\">Austin, Texas&nbsp;</h2>\r\n\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\">We’ve opted to keep Texas Camp in Austin. Keeping the camp in the same city year after year will allow the planning team to focus on iteratively improving the camp year after year. This year, based on feedback from attendees and the planning team, we’ve moved the venue location a bit more central. For 2018 we’ll be at the <a href=\"https://www.google.com/maps/place/Norris+Conference+Centers+-+Austin/@30.3549692,-97.7339511,15z/data=!4m2!3m1!1s0x0:0x5b42d0ec2fb842b1?sa=X&amp;ved=0ahUKEwjWmf2i3OTXAhXl1IMKHf3EA70Q_BIIhwEwCg\">Norris Event Center</a>, which is a bit more centrally located for lodging, dining, and after-party options. &nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<h2 dir=\"ltr\">Save the dates - May 31-June 2</h2>\r\n\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\">The first feedback-based change we’ll be implementing is shifting the camp dates. We’ll stick scheduling the event seven weeks after DrupalCon, but we’ll be moving from Friday, Saturday, Sunday to Thursday, Friday, and Saturday. This will allow our attendees to travel home on Sunday and recoup for the week ahead without disrupting session turnout. It was a bummer for our Sunday speakers who presented to smaller audiences than our Saturday speakers and a bummer for folks who missed out on half the sessions due to flights and long drives. We’d also like to let folks get back to their families without feeling rushed to leave the event.</p>\r\n\r\n<h2>Looking forward</h2>\r\n\r\n<p>The planning for 2018 has already begun, but it’s not too late to join! We’re looking for folks to help with outreach, signal boosting and to help with session selection in April.</p>\r\n\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\">We'd love to hear from people in San Antonio, Dallas, Houston, and Austin to make sure the major markets in the state are included in the planning and promotion.</p>\r\n\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\">Our goal in 2017 was to make an event which Texas Drupalers would be proud of and we think we’ve achieved that goal and then some. Attendee feedback was overwhelmingly positive. Together with the planning team, we’re committed to delivering again in 2018.</p>\r\n\r\n<h2 dir=\"ltr\">You can help make this event a reality&nbsp;</h2>\r\n\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\">We're looking for generous sponsors to help fund this event.

We’ll select camp’s sessions from those, both by ranking and also by topic -- we want to make sure we have a good mix of topics for attendees.</p>\r\n\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\">Pro tip: Want to increase your chances of getting selected?

After the camp, we issued a digital survey to camp-goers to get broader input from those who weren’t able to attend that session. Based on the input from these initiatives, and 2017 attendee demographics, we made a few big changes to the camp!</p>\r\n\r\n<h2 dir=\"ltr\">Austin, Texas&nbsp;</h2>\r\n\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\">We’ve opted to keep Texas Camp in Austin. Keeping the camp in the same city year after year will allow the planning team to focus on iteratively improving the camp year after year. This year, based on feedback from attendees and the planning team, we’ve moved the venue location a bit more central. For 2018 we’ll be at the <a href=\"https://www.google.com/maps/place/Norris+Conference+Centers+-+Austin/@30.3549692,-97.7339511,15z/data=!4m2!3m1!1s0x0:0x5b42d0ec2fb842b1?sa=X&amp;ved=0ahUKEwjWmf2i3OTXAhXl1IMKHf3EA70Q_BIIhwEwCg\">Norris Event Center</a>, which is a bit more centrally located for lodging, dining, and after-party options. &nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<h2 dir=\"ltr\">Save the dates - May 31-June 2</h2>\r\n\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\">The first feedback-based change we’ll be implementing is shifting the camp dates. We’ll stick scheduling the event seven weeks after DrupalCon, but we’ll be moving from Friday, Saturday, Sunday to Thursday, Friday, and Saturday. This will allow our attendees to travel home on Sunday and recoup for the week ahead without disrupting session turnout. It was a bummer for our Sunday speakers who presented to smaller audiences than our Saturday speakers and a bummer for folks who missed out on half the sessions due to flights and long drives. We’d also like to let folks get back to their families without feeling rushed to leave the event.</p>\r\n\r\n<h2>Looking forward</h2>\r\n\r\n<p>The planning for 2018 has already begun, but it’s not too late to join! We’re looking for folks to help with outreach, signal boosting and to help with session selection in April.</p>\r\n\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\">We'd love to hear from people in San Antonio, Dallas, Houston, and Austin to make sure the major markets in the state are included in the planning and promotion.</p>\r\n\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\">Our goal in 2017 was to make an event which Texas Drupalers would be proud of and we think we’ve achieved that goal and then some. Attendee feedback was overwhelmingly positive. Together with the planning team, we’re committed to delivering again in 2018.</p>\r\n\r\n<h2 dir=\"ltr\">You can help make this event a reality&nbsp;</h2>\r\n\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\">We're looking for generous sponsors to help fund this event.

Here’s how the process works:</p>\r\n\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\">We’ll scrub all personally identifiable information from the sessions so that the selection team is unbiased. A volunteer who isn’t on the selection committee will remove all names, gender pronouns, company names, and so on to give everyone a fair chance.</p>\r\n\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\">Each session will be reviewed, evaluated, and given numerical ratings based on each of the following categories:</p>\r\n\r\n<ul>\r\n\t<li>Relevance of the session topic</li>\r\n\t<li>Session description and demonstration of subject mastery</li>\r\n\t<li>Speaker experience, (don’t worry, we won’t penalize you if you’re new to presenting)</li>\r\n\t<li>Experience level</li>\r\n\t<li>Number of submissions the anonymous person already submitted - we try to only have one session per speaker, though we do occasionally break this rule</li>\r\n</ul>\r\n\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\">After each session has been rated by each person on the committee, a spreadsheet will calculate the average of each session’s reviews. We’ll select camp’s sessions from those, both by ranking and also by topic -- we want to make sure we have a good mix of topics for attendees.</p>\r\n\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\">Pro tip: Want to increase your chances of getting selected? We get so few advanced sessions that the odds are greater your session will be selected if it contains advanced material.</p>\r\n\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\">Ain’t sure speaking is right for you?

We're darn proud of this ratio, but know there's room for improvement for next year.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>We were also able to provide vegan and gluten free meals and snack options for folks attending - even at our BBQ location! - giving everyone a seat at the table.&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<h2>Now, for some stats.</h2>\r\n\r\n<ul>\r\n\t<li>Final Texas Camp headcount, including trainers, camp and training attendees: 191&nbsp;</li>\r\n\t<li>Total sponsor dollars raised:&nbsp;$16,050&nbsp;</li>\r\n</ul>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Finally, a well-deserved shout-out to the fine folks who made this event one for the books:</p>\r\n\r\n<h2>Sponsors</h2>\r\n\r\n<p><a href=\"http://amazeelabs.com/\">Amazee Labs</a>&nbsp;-&nbsp;<a href=\"https://pantheon.io/\">Pantheon</a>&nbsp;-&nbsp;<a href=\"https://ffwagency.com/\">FFW</a>&nbsp;-&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.bigtunainteractive.com/\">Big Tuna Creative</a>&nbsp;-&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.achieveinternet.com/\">Achieve Internet</a>&nbsp;-&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.thinkdrop.net/support\">ThinkDrop</a>&nbsp;-&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.drud.com/what-is-ddev/\">DDEV</a>&nbsp;-&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.redfin.com/state/Texas\">REDFIN</a>&nbsp;-&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.kanopistudios.com/\">Kanopi Studios</a>&nbsp;-&nbsp;<a href=\"http://zilleem.com/\">Zilleem</a>&nbsp;-&nbsp;<a href=\"https://softescu.com/\">Softescu&nbsp;</a>-&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.amazee.io/\">amazee.io</a>&nbsp;-&nbsp;<a href=\"https://lastcallmedia.com/\">Last Call Media</a>&nbsp;-&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.fourkitchens.com/\">Four Kitchens</a>&nbsp;-&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.hidglobal.com/\">HID</a>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<h2 dir=\"ltr\">Speakers</h2>\r\n\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\">Nikki Stevens, Michael Schmid, Brian Perry, Dustin Younse, Abby Kingman, Ryan Bateman, Sean Dietrich, Kelly Albrecht, Cecy Correa, Darren Petersen, Jon Pugh, Joe Hyde, Ana Laura Coto Tristan, David Stinemetze, Josh Fabean, Dwayne McDaniel, Tyler Ward, Tearyne Glover, Fito Kahn, Paul Grotevant, Charles Leverington, Carlos Ospina, David Needham, Sean Eddings, Allan Chappell, Susan LaRonde, Tyler Fahey, Kristen Mayer, Kris Vanderwater, Leigh Anderson, Mike Minecki, Patrick Coffey, Mike Minecki, Trasi Judd, Chris Wright, Michael Marsello, Leopoldo Reynaga &nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<h2 dir=\"ltr\"><span>Volunteers</span></h2>\r\n\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\">Stephanie El-Hajj, Andrew McClintock, Brandon Williams, Kristy Moon, Caryn Eaton, Charles Leverington, Leigh Anderson, Rachel Whitton, Carlos Ospina, David Needham, Yes Moon, Kevin Thull</p>\r\n\r\n<h2 dir=\"ltr\">Keep it Going</h2>\r\n<img alt=\"Volunteers having too much fun at Texas Camp\" data-align=\"center\" data-caption=\"Having a blast at Texas Camp\" data-entity-type=\"file\" data-entity-uuid=\"b85a281f-dced-4d76-ba1d-1eb4098ae135\" src=\"/sites/default/files/inline-images/texas%20camp.jpg\" />\r\n<ul dir=\"ltr\">\r\n\t<li><a href=\"https://www.surveymonkey.com/r/N3L38HR\">Take the 2018 Survey</a>&nbsp;</li>\r\n\t<li>Watch the 2018 Texas Camp video <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLHvSm1Lpji2QokZMh3h9IBojYH3i1r_Fq\">playlist</a></li>\r\n\t<li>Take a tour down <a href=\"https://www.flickr.com/photos/155787132@N07/sets/72157669659511438/\">Texas Camp</a> memory lane.
